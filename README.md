# Ownership & Borrowing

This repository contains a simple [Big](https://github.com/tmcw/big/)
presentation, which explores the topic of Ownership and Borrowing in Rust.

It was created for the course Work Integrated Learning, where each member of a
group project created and presented a workshop on a different topic within the
Rust programming language.
